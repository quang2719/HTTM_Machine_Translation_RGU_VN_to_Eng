The history of Vietnam, if counted from the time when humans first inhabited it, dates back to tens of thousands of years before the Common Era, while if counted from the formation of state structures, it dates back to around 700 years before the Common Era. Archaeologists have discovered relics proving that humans lived in Vietnam as early as the Old Stone Age, belonging to the Trang An, Nguom, Son Vi, and Soi Nhu cultures. During the New Stone Age, the Hoa Binh – Bac Son culture in this region developed animal husbandry and agriculture, especially rice cultivation techniques. The prehistoric Vietnamese people in the Red River Delta – the Red River and Ma River civilizations – reclaimed land for farming, created a system of dikes to control floods from the rivers, dug canals for rice cultivation, and established a rice civilization and village culture. Legend has it that the Xich Quy state of the Vietnamese people was formed in 2879 BCE, coinciding with the legend of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors in China. However, this is just a folk legend; archaeological research has yet to find any evidence of this state ever existing. During the Iron Age, around the 8th century BCE, the first Vietnamese state confirmed by archaeology emerged in northern Vietnam today. According to historical records, this was the Van Lang state of the Hung Kings. The era of the Hung Kings is widely recognized as the first organized state of the Vietnamese people, beginning with the legend of the Dragon Descendants and the Fairy Children that Vietnamese people proudly pass down from generation to generation. The area that is now Vietnam has been inhabited since the Old Stone Age. Archaeologists have discovered traces of ancient people residing in Tham Hoi cave, Tham Khuyên cave (Lang Son), Do mountain (Thanh Hoa), Thung Lang (Ninh Binh), and Nga Son, Thanh Hoa, dating back hundreds of thousands of years. During this period, sea levels were lower, and Vietnam was connected to the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan in Indonesia, with a wetter and cooler climate than it is now. Ancient Vietnamese people mined bedrock (basalt) on the mountain slopes, roughly chiseling one side to create pointed tools, long edges, cross edges, scrapers, etc., leaving behind broken pieces of stone (flaked pieces) at the manufacturing site. The relics found on Do Mountain are considered the oldest evidence of human presence in Vietnamese lands, when human social organization had not yet formed. During the period that researchers call the Son Vi Culture, the primitive groups of people living there subsisted on foraging and hunting in a tropical-humid ecosystem with a diverse and abundant world of flora and fauna 11-23 thousand years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. 15,000 – 18,000 years ago, sea levels were low. The Red River Delta at that time extended all the way to Hainan Island and other areas. Geologically, the period around 15,000 BCE (about 18,000 years ago) was the end of the last glacial period, when sea levels gradually rose until about 8,000 years ago, when they suddenly rose about 130 meters (measured from the center of the glacial period, which was North America). Sea levels remained at this level until about 5,500 years ago, when they receded. Corresponding to this period, archaeological sites show that sea levels flooded the entire Red River Delta today, reaching as far as Vinh Phuc for nearly 3,000 years. Due to this geological characteristic, the Red River Delta and the Gulf of Tonkin do not have conditions for excavating ancient soil layers dating back to about 8,000 BCE (before the Great Flood) to confirm the presence of other civilizations, if any. Vietnamese history has an undefined gap from around 5,500 years ago to 18,000 years ago. Following the Son Vi Culture came the Hoa Binh and Bac Son cultures, belonging to the New Stone Age. The Hoa Binh Culture is recognized as the cradle of the rice civilization, originating from Southeast Asia and dating back to around 15,000 years ago. Due to geological features related to the flood, it is possible that part of the flourishing development of the Hoa Binh Culture may never have been discovered. Archaeologists have linked the beginning of the Vietnamese civilization to the end of the New Stone Age and the beginning of the Bronze Age (around 5,700 years BCE). The Phung Nguyen Culture is a prehistoric culture belonging to the early Bronze Age, at the end of the New Stone Age, dating back about 4,000 to 3,500 years. Phung Nguyen is the name of a village in Kinh Ke Commune, Lam Thao District, Phu Tho Province, where the first archaeological sites of this culture were found. The Dong Dau Culture is a Bronze Age culture in Vietnam dating back about 3,000 years, after the Phung Nguyen Culture and before the Go Mun Culture. The name of this culture is taken from the Dong Dau archaeological site in Yen Lac Town, Yen Lac District, Vinh Phuc Province. Around 1200 BCE, the development of rice cultivation techniques and bronze casting in the Ma River region and the Red River Delta led to the development of the Dong Son Culture, notable for its bronze drums. The weapons, tools, and bronze drums excavated from the Dong Son Culture attest to the origin of bronze casting techniques here; many ancient small copper mines have been excavated in northern Vietnam. Here, archaeologists have found coffin and burial jars shaped like boats, stilt houses, and evidence of the custom of chewing betel nuts and dyeing teeth black. According to some ancient history books, the ancient Vietnamese tribes (Bach Viet) lived in the Ling Nam region, encompassing a vast area south of the Yangtze River in present-day China to the Red River and Ma River deltas in northern Vietnam. Legend has it that the Xich Quy state of the Vietnamese tribes was formed in 2879 BCE in the Dongting Lake region (Hunan Province, present-day China). Currently, there is no archaeological evidence to confirm the existence of the Xich Quy state; it is only a mythical entity like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period in China. If a coalition of ancient Vietnamese tribes (Xich Quy) did indeed exist during this period, it can be said that it was only a loose alliance of different Vietnamese tribal groups such as Dien Viet in Yunnan, Da Lang in Guizhou, Min Viet in Fujian, Dong Viet in Zhejiang, Son Viet in Jiangxi, Nam Viet in Guangdong, Au Viet (Western Au Viet) in Guangxi, and Lac Viet in northern Vietnam. These Vietnamese tribal groups differed significantly in language, customs, and habitats; their relations were mainly based on trade, not a unified state. During the Spring and Autumn – Warring States periods (8th century BCE to 3rd century BCE), due to pressure from the Wu and Qin kingdoms in northern China and the influx of Han Chinese fleeing war from the north, the ancient Vietnamese tribes gradually lost territory, and some Vietnamese tribes were assimilated into the Han Chinese. The peak of this process was during the Qin Shi Huang era, when the territory of China extended south to the coast of Guangdong. The upheavals during this period also led to the disintegration of the coalition of Vietnamese tribes; from the 8th century BCE onwards, from the Vietnamese tribes residing in different areas south of the Yangtze River, different states were formed in different regions and eras, including Viet, Van Lang, Viet Thuong, Nam Viet, Au Lac, Quy Viet, Min Viet, Dong Viet, etc. These tribes were gradually defeated and annexed by the Chinese dynasties north of the Yangtze River, or they were weakened by internal conflicts. By the Han Dynasty in the 1st century BCE, all Vietnamese states had been annexed. By the 8th century BCE, independent states of Vietnamese tribes gradually formed throughout the area south of the Yangtze River. Modern research materials and archaeological evidence largely agree with the account of the Viet Su Luoc (Vietnamese History Outline) regarding a Van Lang kingdom of the Lac Viet people, founded in the 7th century BCE, coinciding with the era of King Zhuang of Zhou (696 BCE – 682 BCE) in China. This kingdom existed in the area that is today the midlands and Red River Delta of northern Vietnam, as well as the three provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh. This state likely traded with other Vietnamese tribes and possibly with the Viet state of Viet King Gou Jian in the lower Yangtze River region (present-day China). The Van Lang state apparatus initially imitated the monarchical system. At the center, King Hung presided, assisted by Lac Lords and Lac Generals. Locally, the country was divided into 15 departments (representing the 15 tribes of the Red River Delta before the formation of the state), each governed by a Lac General. Below the department were villages, governed by Bo chiefs. In the 3rd century BCE, Thuc Phan, leader of the Au Viet tribe – one of the Bach Viet tribes north of Van Lang – defeated Hung King the 18th and established the Au Lac state. The Au Viet – Lac Viet coalition state defeated the Qin invasion. The state established its capital at Co Loa, in present-day Dong Anh District, Hanoi. Thuc Phan proclaimed himself An Duong Vuong (King An Duong). Au Lac under An Duong Vuong was annexed by Zhao Tuo (a former general of the Qin Dynasty) in 208 BCE (or 179 BCE). The issue of the Northern Domination is still debated in Vietnamese history, with two different perspectives. Most historical views during the feudal period consider the Zhao Dynasty to be a dynasty in Vietnamese history, so the Northern Domination began in 111 BCE when the Han Dynasty conquered Nam Viet. The second perspective emerged in the 18th century when historian Ngo Thi Si refuted the Zhao Dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of Vietnam because Zhao Tuo was originally a Han Chinese from the north, a general who conquered the south under the orders of Qin Shi Huang. This view was continued by historian Dao Duy Anh in the 20th century, and current history textbooks in Vietnam follow this perspective. According to this second perspective, the Northern Domination in Vietnamese history began in 179 BCE when the Zhao Dynasty conquered Au Lac under An Duong Vuong. At the end of the Qin Dynasty, Zhao Tuo (from the Zhao state during the Warring States period, now Hebei Province, China) was appointed County Magistrate of Long Xuyen County by the Qin Dynasty, and later appointed by Ren Ngao as Prefect of Nanhai County (in present-day Guangdong Province). Taking advantage of the chaos in the Qin Dynasty after the death of Qin Shi Huang (210 BCE), Zhao Tuo seceded and established himself in Nanhai County, then conquered and annexed the Au Lac kingdom and the neighboring Gui Lin County, establishing a separate state called Nam Viet with its capital at Phien Ngung (now Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province) in 207 BCE. The Nam Viet state during the Zhao Dynasty included the areas of present-day Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in China and northern Vietnam today. Nam Viet was divided into four counties: Nanhai, Gui Lin, Giao Chi, and Cuu Chan. The northern border was the Wuling mountain range, and the southern border was the Hoanh Son mountain range. After the Han Dynasty was established and unified all of China, Zhao Tuo proclaimed himself Emperor of Nam Viet to show his equality with the Western Han Dynasty. For 68 years (179 BCE – 111 BCE), present-day northern Vietnam was part of the Nam Viet state, ruled by a Chinese king who did not recognize the Han Dynasty's rule. In 111 BCE, the army of Han Emperor Wu conquered Nam Viet and annexed it into the Han Empire. The Chinese wanted to control the Red River Delta to have a stopping point for ships trading with Southeast Asia. In the 1st century, Lac Viet generals still held positions, but China began a policy of assimilation by increasing taxes and reforming marriage laws to turn Vietnam into a patriarchal society, making it easier to absorb political power. An uprising led by the Trung Sisters erupted in Giao Chi County, followed by the counties of Cuu Chan, Nhat Nam, Hop Pho, and other localities in the Ling Nam region (which, according to Vietnamese ancient history, had a total of 65 fortresses) in 40 CE. The Han Dynasty then sent General Ma Yuan to suppress the uprising. After three years of independence, the uprising was suppressed by General Ma Yuan. Due to isolation and an unorganized army, the Trung Sisters were unable to resist the forces commanded by Ma Yuan. The Trung Sisters committed suicide on the Hat River to preserve their honor. Following the Han Dynasty, other subsequent Chinese feudal dynasties such as Eastern Wu, Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi, and Liang took turns ruling Vietnam. The Vietnamese people also revolted several times against foreign rule, but none of them achieved the goal of independence. Notable uprisings include the uprising of the brothers Trieu Quoc Dat and Trieu Thi Trinh during the Eastern Wu period. The uprising of the brothers Ly Truong Nhan and Ly Thuc Hien during the Northern Domination of Liu Song and Southern Qi from 468 to 485. In 541, Ly Bi revolted and drove out the governor of the Liang Dynasty, Xiao Tư. After defeating the Liang army three times in subsequent years, Ly Bi proclaimed himself emperor, known as Ly Nam De, founding the Van Xuan state in 544. In 545, the Liang Dynasty sent Trần Bá Tiên and Dương Phiêu to attack Van Xuan, and Ly Nam De was defeated, handing over military command to Trieu Quang Phuc. After Ly Nam De's death, Trieu Quang Phuc drove out the Liang army in 550, protecting the Van Xuan state. He proclaimed himself Trieu Viet Vuong. In 571, a nephew of Ly Nam De, Ly Phat Tu, usurped the throne of Trieu Viet Vuong, continuing to maintain independence for the Vietnamese people for another 20 years until the Sui Dynasty attacked in 602. Following the Sui Dynasty, the Tang Dynasty ruled Vietnam for nearly 300 years. China reached its peak during the Tang Dynasty, expanding in all four directions. In the north, they established the An Bei Protectorate, in the east they attacked Goguryeo and established the An Dong Protectorate, in the west they established the An Xi Protectorate, and in the south they established the An Nam Protectorate, which was the territory of the former Van Xuan state. During the Tang Dynasty, Vietnamese people launched uprisings against the Northern Domination, such as the uprising of Ly Tu Tien and Dinh Kien, the uprising of Mai Hac De, the uprising of Phung Hung, and the uprising of Duong Thanh from the late 7th century to the 9th century. After the An Lushan Rebellion (756–763), the Tang Dynasty weakened and lost control of many localities due to warlord rebellions, unable to control the south. The An Nam Protectorate was ravaged by neighboring Nan Zhao, Champa, and Sailendra, who killed and captured many locals. Nan Zhao alone killed and captured 150,000 people, and the Tang army was defeated many times. In 866, the Tang Dynasty regained control and renamed it Jinghai Army. In the late 9th century, the Tang Dynasty was severely weakened after the rebellion of Huang Chao and the warlord wars in China. In Vietnam, in 905, a local Vietnamese chieftain, Khuc Thua Du, seized the capital of Dai La, marking the beginning of the Vietnamese people's self-rule. Chinese dynasties attempted to assimilate the Vietnamese people into the Han ethnicity. However, despite being heavily influenced by the political, social, and cultural organization of China, the Vietnamese people still retained many of their fundamental cultural characteristics after a thousand years of domination. The Vietnamese people were also influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, which was flourishing in East Asia, although Southeast Asia was already influenced by Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism was blended with Confucianism, Taoism, and local folk beliefs. In 905, Khuc Thua Du established the Vietnamese self-governing regime during the weakening of the Tang Dynasty, laying the foundation for Vietnam's independence. In 939, Ngo Quyen proclaimed himself king after the historical battle on the Bach Dang River against the Southern Han forces. In 968, Dinh Bo Linh proclaimed himself emperor, founding the Dinh Dynasty (968–980) and naming the country Dai Co Viet. In 980, Le Hoan ascended the throne, founding the Earlier Le Dynasty (980–1009). In 1009, Ly Cong Uan ascended the throne, founding the Ly Dynasty (1009–1225). In 1054, King Ly Thanh Tong changed the country's name to Dai Viet. During this period, Vietnam went through many feudal regimes: the Ngo Dynasty (939–965), the Dinh Dynasty (968–980), the Earlier Le Dynasty (980–1009), the Ly Dynasty (1009–1225), the Tran Dynasty (1226–1400), and the Ho Dynasty (1400–1407). During this time, the Northern dynasties in China and Mongolia sent troops to invade Vietnam but were all repelled: Le Hoan and Ly Thuong Kiet repelled the Song forces twice (in 981 and 1076), the Tran Dynasty defeated the Mongol forces in 1258 and then the Yuan Dynasty in 1285 and 1288. At the beginning of the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty conquered Dai Viet and ruled for 20 years, but they were also driven out by Le Loi's uprising in 1428, who established the Later Le Dynasty. In 1789, the Qing Dynasty invaded but was defeated by Nguyen Hue. However, from the late 18th century onwards, feudal Vietnam began to weaken. From the 10th to the 14th centuries, the Dai Viet dynasties built their state based on Buddhism, along with Confucian influences from China. Towards the end of the 14th century, the influence of Buddhism gradually declined and that of Confucianism increased. The development of a Confucian state based on the Chinese model led to Dai Viet having a political structure similar to that of its neighbor, China, in the 15th century. Its legal structure, administration, literature, and art all followed the Chinese style. Along with adopting the political model and social organization of China, Vietnamese dynasties from the 10th century onwards gradually expanded their influence beyond the Red River Delta. From the Ly Dynasty onwards, through marriages, military campaigns, and the enfeoffment of tribal leaders in the mountains, the Ly, Tran, and Le dynasties successively annexed and incorporated other ethnic groups in the Northwest and Northeast into the Dai Viet state. Together with the Vietnamese people, the mountain tribes joined forces with the Vietnamese people in the struggle against foreign invasion and the building of the country. Vietnam during the feudal period continued to rely on agriculture, mainly rice cultivation, to provide food. Each dynasty successively built dikes to prevent floods, dug canals for irrigation and transportation, and reclaimed land in the coastal plains to increase the area for cultivation. Commercial and foreign trade activities also began to take shape. In addition to its two neighboring countries, China and Champa, during the Ly Dynasty and the Tran Dynasty, Vietnam also traded with other kingdoms in Southeast Asia at the Van Don port (Quang Ninh). During the Later Le Dynasty, Vietnam traded with Europe and Japan at centers like Thang Long and Hoi An. In 1407, the Ming forces invaded Dai Ngu on the pretext of driving out the Ho Dynasty and restoring the Tran Dynasty (Fu Tran Die Ho). The Ming forces quickly defeated the Dai Ngu forces. This period is known as the Fourth Northern Domination. The forces of the Later Tran Dynasty revolted from 1407–1413 to resist the Ming forces but were also suppressed. A Giao Chi leader, Le Loi, revolted against the Ming rule. The Lam Son uprising won in 1427, and Le Loi ascended the throne, establishing the Later Le Dynasty. In 1427, Le Loi established the Later Le Dynasty after defeating the Ming forces. This period is also known as the Early Le Dynasty. Originating in the period of the Southern – Northern Dynasties, in 1527, after seizing the throne from the Later Le Dynasty, Mac Dang Dung established the Mac Dynasty. The Later Le Dynasty (called the Restored Le Dynasty by historians) was re-established a few years later with the help of Nguyen Kim, a former general, who gained control of the area from Thanh Hoa to Binh Dinh. After Nguyen Kim's death, his son-in-law, Trinh Kiem, seized power. Over the next 60 years, Trinh Kiem and his descendants defeated the Mac Dynasty in 1592, ushering in a special period in Vietnamese feudal history, the era of the Le kings and Trinh lords. During this period, Vietnam went through many feudal regimes: the Mac Dynasty (1527–1592), the Restored Le Dynasty (1533–1789), the Trinh lords (1545–1787), the Nguyen lords (1558–1777), and the Tay Son Dynasty (1778–1802). The conflict between two close advisors of the Restored Le Dynasty, Trinh Kiem and Nguyen Hoang (governor of Thuan Hoa and Quang Nam), marked the beginning of the division of the country into two territories. While Trinh Kiem found an excuse to kill Nguyen Uong (the eldest son of Nguyen Kim), Nguyen Hoang fled to Thuan Hoa and established himself there, forming two separate regimes, the North and the South, with the Gianh River (Quang Binh) as the border. Trinh Kiem's descendants successively took over power in the North, known as the Trinh lords, and Nguyen Hoang's descendants successively held power in the South, known as the Nguyen lords. The Le kings only held the title of Emperor of Dai Viet in name. The period when Dai Viet was divided into two separate territories, the North and the South, was also a period of vibrant foreign trade. Both the North and the South participated in the global trade system as European, Japanese, and Chinese merchants came to Dai Viet to trade. The Dutch, English, and French established trading posts at Ke Cho (Hanoi), and the Portuguese, English, and Japanese established trading posts at Faifo (Hoi An). The main goods exported from Dai Viet were silk, pepper, and ceramics. However, in the 18th century, trade activity declined in both the North and the South. Along with trade with Western countries and Japan, Catholicism began to be introduced into Dai Viet through Western missionaries who came on trading ships to preach in both the North and the South. The solid foundation of Catholicism in Vietnam was built by the Jesuit missionaries under the patronage of Portugal in the 17th century. Some prominent French missionaries also provided manpower and resources to the Nguyen Dynasty in their war against the Tay Son Dynasty, leading to the victory of King Gia Long. By the mid-19th century, there were about 450,000 Catholics. The Nguyen Dynasty government under these kings was concerned about the growing power of a different and organized religion, so they ordered the banning of Catholic missionary work and suppressed Catholics, leveling many Catholic villages. On August 31, 1858, the French navy landed and attacked the port of Da Nang and then withdrew to invade Saigon. In June 1862, King Tu Duc signed a treaty ceding three eastern provinces to France. In 1867, France took over the three western provinces to form a colonial territory called Cochinchina. After consolidating its position in Cochinchina, France invaded the rest of Vietnam from 1873 to 1886 through complex wars in Tonkin. Northern Vietnam at that time was very chaotic due to conflicts between the Vietnamese and Chinese expatriates. The Vietnamese government was unable to control this conflict. Both China and France considered this area to be within their sphere of influence and sent troops there, but ultimately the French won. France declared that it would "protect" Tonkin and Annam, where they continued to maintain the Nguyen kings until Bao Dai (king from 1926 to 1945) and their officials. The Nguyen Dynasty continued to exist in Annam and Tonkin but had limited power; all major issues had to be approved by the French Governor-General of Indochina. In 1885, Vietnamese officials organized the Can Vuong resistance movement against France but were defeated. The Nguyen kings, Ham Nghi, Duy Tan, and Thanh Thai, who were resistant, were dethroned and exiled by the French. In 1887, having completed the conquest of Vietnam, the French established a fairly complete governing apparatus, from the central government to the local level. At the center was the Governor-General of Indochina (initially headquartered in Saigon, moved to Hanoi in 1902). The head of the Governor-General was called the Governor-General of Indochina, who had the highest authority in the French political system throughout Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, and Cambodia. At the head of the three provinces were the Governor of Cochinchina, the Resident Superior of Annam, and the Governor of Tonkin, all of whom were under the direct supervision and control of the French Governor-General, subordinate to the Ministry of Colonies. In 1893, the French Governor-General's control expanded to include Laos. After the failure of the Can Vuong movement in the late 19th century, the French completely consolidated their rule in Vietnam. Educational reforms in the 1910s completely eliminated the Confucian education system with Chinese characters, which had existed for thousands of years in feudal Vietnam, and replaced it with a new learning movement based on the national language, creating a new class of intellectuals, those who came from the Confucian tradition but were exposed to Western culture. Prominent figures among this group were Phan Chau Trinh and Phan Boi Chau, who initiated the Duy Tan Movement and the Dong Du Movement, advocating for the improvement of education, democracy, human rights, and social reform for the Vietnamese people under French rule. However, the development of these movements was later suppressed by the colonial government because they recognized the threat they posed to their colonial regime. In the late 1920s, Vietnamese progressives influenced by the Three Principles of the People founded the Vietnam Nationalist Party.
